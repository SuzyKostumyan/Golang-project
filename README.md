# Golang-project

# Additional requirements

1.  We can adopt a streaming approach where the file is read line by line and processed incrementally.
2.  When a new file arrives, we only process the records that are not already present in the storage. This update strategy reduces the processing time and avoids unnecessary rewrites of existing data.
3.  We can use caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the load on the storage system. Technologies such as Redis can be used for efficient caching.
4.  Deployment: Containerize the application using Docker and orchestrate it using Kubernetes or a similar container orchestration platform.
